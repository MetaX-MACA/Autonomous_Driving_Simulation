# MetaX-Autonomous Driving Scene Reconstruction & Simulation Solution

English | [中文版](README_zh.md)

## About

This solution targets the autonomous driving research field. Leveraging the powerful training and inference capabilities of MetaX's C500 GPUs, combined with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for scene reconstruction, it enables high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction through techniques such as foreground-background separation and independent rigid/non-rigid modeling. This allows for convenient scene editing operations, such as deleting specific rigid instances.
