## About

This solution is designed for the field of autonomous driving research. Leveraging the powerful training and inference capabilities of the MetaX C-series GPUs and the general understanding and reasoning abilities of LLMs, it enables the generation of highly flexible and editable photorealistic scenario videos based on complex language commands.

This project is based on [ChatSim](https://github.com/yifanlu0227/ChatSim). ChatSim is an editable scene simulation for autonomous driving via LLM-Agent collaboration, it can perform flexible and diverse editing of autonomous driving scenarios based on natural language text input by users.
